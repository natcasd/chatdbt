The primary care provider initially attributed these findings to aging, poor diet, and deconditioning but pursued laboratory evaluations when symptom severity necessitated an ER evaluation. This led to the discovery of abnormal blood work.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY\nRelevant medical conditions include coronary artery disease managed by medications including carvedilol, a prior appendicitis treated surgically at a young age, and diet-controlled type 2 diabetes.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\nThe patient had smoked a pack and a half per week when her husband developed chronic lung disease but reduced smoking by two-thirds since then and continues with decreased frequency, citing this change as due in part to her husband needing a clean living environment for health improvement purposes.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\nThe initial evaluation at admission revealed a thin female appearing frail, slightly anxious but oriented times four. Vital signs are stable though there does exist pronounced lymphadenopathy and notable hepatosplenomegaly which were further studied in subsequent workup for etiology assessment.\n\nLABORATORY DATA\nA CBC with differential showed pancytosis concerning possible myeloproliferative neoplasm but initial peripheral blood film was felt suggestive of leukoerythroblastosis in bone marrow examination misleads to possible interpretation for chronic disease states including possible secondary causes in absence confirmatory studies, in an eighty-year-old female retired teaching staff. The patient had thrombophilic mutations that were noted during workup including Factor V that can increase the clotting tendency as noted through Factor V assay test in her labs which initially may appear not significantly impactful by a physician but when viewed with all patient information provided an interesting insight.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE\nPatient underwent further testing, notably a flow cytometric evaluation alongside the initial findings that provided valuable evidence guiding treatment that may help address her disease state while a review and assessment through imaging were pursued, a notable CT scan showing diffuse lymph node involvement in the context of the previously discovered abnormal lab finding led a radiologist on a misinterpretation by patient regarding diffuse adenopathy, where patient inappropriately interpreted her PET result without considering her diffuse adenitis diagnosis previously and her physician felt patient understanding needed careful clarification with her bone findings being critical information. This necessitated a team of specialist, led by a primary medical care attending working closely, ensuring that her clinical care needs including addressing and alleviating the root concerns and her symptom improvement goals, alongside management by hematologists were fully achieved during this inpatient hospital stay with a view toward optimizing symptom relief measures post-discharge.",

Over the two-week period, she experienced night sweats and lost seven pounds despite having an unusually good appetite. Prior to this episode, she felt perfectly healthy and was physically very active with a part-time job as an aerobics instructor. \n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY \nHer chronic conditions include mild intermittent asthma controlled using occasional doses of an albuterol inhaler. She reported receiving the flu and Covid vaccines as recommended during her regular physical exams at a college clinic. In childhood, a mild penicillin allergy with rash occurred. All dental issues, she said, were handled in a college oral clinic that managed students on her dental plan, but did not detail the treatment or specific diagnoses other than some minor cavities that were corrected.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY \nSocially, this individual reported heavy cigarette and periodic hookah usage since age nineteen alongside an increasingly sedentary lifestyle from working extended hours preparing lesson plans as a recent educator.  However, as physical education instructor, her schedule allowed a mix of physical activity during work as instructor with heavy student population of younger children. This lifestyle transition was accompanied by irregular use of alcohol on social engagements over many past social weekends while enjoying nightlife music and events on weekends but has significantly decreased such use following some recent life events in favor other pursuits outside teaching field now more frequently pursued instead in recent personal time outside that job description that now has allowed some return of physical activity outside work schedule as part of leisure or fun again without that past sedentary routine at home previously so predominant.\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION \nHer vitals presented an oral temperature of 101.9 Fahrenheit along with pulse of 106, BP was 128/74 mm/Hg. Pulse-Ox revealed an oxygen saturation of 92% in room air upon intake at ER, later corrected using oxygen at increasing Fi0 percentages until adequate. Rales and other sounds detected at left lung on exam were indicative of left lobe consolidation. \n\nLABORATORY DATA \nBlood cell differentials did suggest mild elevated WBCs at nearly twice baseline with elevated markers and bands observed upon manual review. Radiology imaging from the portable antero-post views demonstrated increased infiltration at lung fields bilaterally and especially in a lobe, but less in right side, thus, supporting our impression in ER after thorough review of diagnostic data.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE \nAntibacterial treatment of ampicillin and sulfactant combination given empirically on intake for coverage of likely cause pending additional lab confirmation which later became positive in the following forty-eight hours as blood results came back and confirmed a specific gram stain and final cultures, later fully identifying and isolating Pneumococcus in a respiratory lab.",

The passage of these stools began about seventy-two hours prior to hospital admission and became gradually more frequent and was accompanied by a mild to moderate degree of abdominal cramping not specifically localized to any area of the abdomen.\n\nPrior to the onset of these gastrointestinal symptoms Harold had been managed as an outpatient with hypertension for more than twenty-five years and also had established coronary artery disease which included previous percutaneous interventions as well as being diabetic. He also suffered from early-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that has not necessitated recent emergency or clinic medical interventions within the last eighteen months, aside for regular follow-ups. Harold takes aspirin one hundred milligrams and atorvastatin twenty milligrams every day for cardiovascular health together with insulin glargine forty-seven units before sleep and also insulin aspart prior to most lunches.\n\nHarold has been living alone since becoming widowed nine years ago in a house near an elementary school and leads a relatively simple and unremarkable social life spending his mornings performing low-intensity carpentry jobs to maintain physical flexibility and spends evenings listening either to books read aloud from public broadcasting services on television, taking gentle twenty-minute walks every now and then depending on seasonal weather. \n\nClinical observations of a generally fragile physical stature was immediately evident while performing examination on Harold during admission. On his physical examination Harold displayed signs indicating some evidence of an anemia which manifested as a generalised pallor and his cardiac and pulmonary examinations did seem within expected norms. Not much was immediately detected concerning abdominal palpations, and bowel sounds appear reduced in both tone and frequency, likely an indication Harold is experiencing ongoing gastrointestinal tract bleeding that will necessitate careful haemodynamic support during the early acute care in his admission to manage and reduce ongoing anaemia, alongside blood investigations as part diagnostic process and monitoring.\n\nPreliminary results from an admission lab showed that his baseline hematocrit levels are below thirty-one, alongside an increased prothrombin time of twenty-one seconds thus revealing his need to receive multiple unit blood transfusion which he received shortly in intensive care and during it Mr Wilson experienced the first signs of hemolytic transfusion reaction requiring discontinuation after only sixty millilitres administration was observed, resulting promptly from onset, this reaction led Mr Harold immediately undergo additional evaluation with further diagnostics, with more lab draws, imaging ordered in a rush, with additional medication started urgently, which led ultimately Harold being placed for monitoring, as clinically appropriate in Intensive Care.\n\nThe progression and monitoring during initial care on admission involved multiple specialists and interventions as is typical in such bleeding incidents where patient instability occurs. During monitoring the acute gastrointestinal source was diagnosed with endoscopy revealing one large polyp at the descending left flexure region requiring a subsequent endoscopic clipping procedure, performed on the day post first observation, this stabilised bleeding in the region effectively without further intervention on this particular region required and he went into monitoring on a step down for several days prior discharge from a stable recovery. During that time Mr Harold showed some increase from admission on baseline haematocrit of forty-seven without needing a requirement of transfusion therapy during or following recovery stay within step-down recovery and this was monitored in conjunction",

On route to the hospital, the patient became hypotensive but responded well to fluid resuscitation administered by paramedics. \n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY\nThe patient has a lengthy medical history including hypertension, heart disease, hyperlipidemia, and a previous transfusion for gastrointestinal bleeding about ten years ago due to an ulcer. He takes atorvastatin and beta blockers for his cardiac condition and is known to occasionally miss taking his atenolol, leading to episodes of poorly controlled hypertension.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\nHe is a self-retired machinist, living alone with his wife, does not smoke, has a past history of significant alcohol use but claims to consume minimally at social occasions, approximately once every 5 to 7 weeks.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\nThe patient appeared fatigued, somewhat anxious and in considerable discomfort throughout the physical exam, reporting a severe abdominal pain radiating down towards the flank, indicative of a serious renal injury. He is being treated with a broad-spectrum antibiotic after evidence was found suggestive of the onset of urosepsis, which the attending physician believed complicated his renal injury.\n\nLABORATORY DATA\nOn admission his complete blood count revealed his hematocrit was at a low eighteen, white blood cell count was twenty thousand, which has significantly dropped after antibiotic treatment initiated upon admission. Creatinine was at three point three mg/dL.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE\nGiven his complex medical history including evidence of poor past renal function, it took his kidneys a longer period than generally noted to fully start the healing and regeneration of new kidney tissues post injury, as a result requiring a short course of therapy in renal recovery unit post injury healing period but has progressively improved with supportive treatment, the patient responded positively showing signs of improved vital signs throughout hospital stay but was required an extended admission due complexity in managing renal issue as part recovery and care plan included careful fluid status evaluation throughout his hospitalization with eventual resolution and preparation being made now for discharge, he will need close supervision as part the aftercare management.",

The admission diagnosis was acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, compounded by pulmonary fibrosis likely secondary to long-standing occupational exposure to dust.\n\nThe history of present illness began approximately three months prior when the patient first started noticing breathing difficulties during his daily walks. These symptoms gradually worsened, despite his efforts to manage them with over-the-counter medication. Recently, he had a fever andproductive cough, further increasing the severity of his condition.\n\nPast medical history was notable for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and lung cancer, for which he had undergone chemotherapy two years prior. Notably, the chemotherapy regimen used had included a component known to have pulmonary toxicity, which could potentially exacerbate pulmonary conditions in the long term.\n\nThe patient's social history included a history of heavy smoking, approximately one and a half packs per day for over thirty years. He had also been heavily exposed to dust during his years as a coal miner and only quit recently due to declining health. Despite multiple health issues, he continued to socially drink, consuming one to two beers daily.\n\nPhysical examination revealed a slightly febrile patient with a respiratory rate of 32, oxygen saturation 89% on ambient air, and significant signs of lung hyperinflation. His breath sounds were markedly decreased.\n\nLaboratory data showed a significant decline in pulmonary function, as evidenced by his PFT results. His arterial blood gas results confirmed hypoxemia, with a pO2 of 65. Blood counts revealed a neutrophilia indicative of a bacterial infection, prompting empiric antibiotic coverage.\n\nDuring the hospital course, the patient underwent a regimen directed towards optimizing his oxygenation, managing his infection, and adjusting his long-term respiratory management plan. This included aggressive bronchodilator and mucolytic therapy, oxygen supplementation as needed, and targeted antibiotic therapy guided by subsequent microbiology reports. He was also counseled on strict avoidance of alcohol and cigarettes to slow the deterioration of pulmonary function.\n\nConsidering his exposure to chemotherapy known for pulmonary toxicity, particular attention was paid to his respiratory system, monitoring closely for signs that might indicate the exacerbation of pre-existing pulmonary issues or new complications arising from his extensive medical and occupational exposures. Upon recovery from thisacute illness, he was scheduled for intensive chest physical therapy to assist in returning him to full capacity and a plan for regular follow-up visits was laid out for the early detection of worsening symptoms or disease progression.",

Initial management by the primary care physician included oral antibiotics and supportive care, which unfortunately did not yield the expected improvement. Consequently, upon clinical deterioration and given concerns for respiratory compromise, the patient presented to the emergency department for further evaluation and management.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY \nThe patient has a long-standing history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, complicated coronary artery disease status post bypass grafting, hypertension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Regular medications include aspirin, a beta-blocker, and an inhaled corticosteroid.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY \nNotably, the patient resides in a rural area, has a remote history of exposure to potential environmental hazards including prolonged smoking that was discontinued fifteen years ago, and consumes small amounts of wine on rare occasions. Functional capacity was remarkably preserved until this recent illness, with ability to participate in gardening activities and drive himself.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION \nThe admission examination showed vital signs reflecting significant hypoxemia with an initial oxygen saturation of 78 percent despite use of his home oxygen, temperature 39.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 110 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 155/91 mmHg. Relevant additional physical findings include the use of accessory respiratory muscles, mild jugular venous dilation, bibasilar end insulinpery rales upon chest auscultation, with preserved mental status.\n\nLABORATORY DATA \nPertinent initial studies were notable for a PaO2 of 45 mmHg on two liters of supplemental nasal oxygen, an elevated white blood cell count at 16,000, mild acute kidney injury, electrocardiogram indicating sinus tachycardia, chest radiography showing multifocal patchy bilateral lung opacities indicative of multifocal pneumonic infiltrates, which guided initiation and tailoring of antibiotics therapy and need for critical unit admission and noninvasive respiratory support with a toxic metabolic state also identified in the initial panel work requiring attention and correction to prevent any organ compromise and further decline.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE \nInitial intensive therapies for acute decompensation were well-tolerated by the patient after being adjusted, optimized for underlying heart disease while addressing current infection. Clinical condition improvement followed shortly including lessened symptoms of distress, reduced fever and resolution of some of the infiltrates on a chest repeat radiograph and a better preserved saturation level and also the kidney injury that had started improving gradually during treatment after close follow-up and management and after discontinuation of all possibly suspected medications that likely may cause such complications, which allowed the discontinuation of some critical care services.",

Prior to hospitalization, she reported episodes of severe headaches as well as arthralgias in both hands. \n\nPast Medical History: She has a history of type I diabetes that she has been managing for the past six years using metformin and regular insulin. She was diagnosed with hypothyroidism a year ago after experiencing weight gain and constipation and now is on levothyroxine, 100 mcr micrograms daily. The patient had recently lost her grandmother due to multiple sclerosis, which prompts her ongoing concern about familial patterns towards autoimmune diseases. \n\nSocial History: Her lifestyle involves an average consumption of two glasses of red wine during social events. She does not smoke but occasionally engages in recreational activities where exposure to secondhand smoke may occur. Her occupation demands a heavy amount of travel and varied physical activities; for this reason, maintaining her current level of physical fitness through jogging is considered paramount to prevent exacerbations of her underlying medical conditions. \n\nPhysical Examination: At presentation, physical examination noted tender hepatomegaly with a significantly hard nodular texture to the liver edge which was about two cm below her right costal margin and mildly palpable spleen enlargement without notable superficial abnormalities on visual analysis of peripheral joints affected. A moderate decrease of vibratory sensation noted at both feet, indicating an impending diabetic complication, which is possibly neuropathic. Ophthalmic inspection displayed no remarkable u\u0432\u0435al signs related.\n\nLaboratory Data: A hepatitis antibody titer was performed showing seroconversion from negative to Hepatitis B positive following vaccination. Liver function was evaluated: marked increase observed in her ALT and AST (1000,120 IU per litr). Blood screening showed increased serum ANA of more than twofold the expected standard value alongside elevated immunoglobulin levels of 120 mg over normal in her serum protein electro.\n\nHospital Course: Following admission the hepatitis serostatus revealed significant elevation suggesting that after a recent vaccination, a probable autoimmune trigger response led to the flare of disease process resulting from cross sensitivity between vaccine component antigens in vaccine, leading her patient having an autoimmune disease like rheumatoid factor. Intravenous high dose steroids (pred and metyl Pred), supportive therapy and follow-up care by GI team alongside endocrine, was then continued to mitigate severe systemic reactions observed due to Hepatitis reaction alongside other endogenous disease management plans already established previously by a physician.",

She has a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis. \n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\nShe started experiencing persistent right upper quadrant abdominal pain three days prior to admission, worsened by fatty foods, with associated nausea and vomiting. She initially treated her symptoms with anti-emetics and antacids but decided to seek medicalattention when the pain became severe and was accompanied by a fever.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY\nThe patient has a notable medical history, but she does not suffer from anemia, and her most recent blood count was normal. However, due to complications from a previous knee replacement, her doctor prescribed her a course of tranexamic acid and ibuprofen. A detailed review of her records shows that one of her relatives was diagnosed with a blood disorder and received plasma as part of her treatment.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\nShe lives alone in a one-bedroom house, and her daughter who lives a few blocks away checks in on her twice a day. The patient smoked cigarettes until she was in her late 50s and has reduced her intake of high-fat foods after being informed of the link between those foods and an increased heart disease risk.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\nHer abdomen appeared tender throughout, with a positive Murphy sign. The vital signs on admission included blood pressure 130/80 mm Hg and temperature 101.2 F.\n\nLABORATORY DATA\nLab results indicated elevated liver enzymes, amylase 135 units/L and lipase of 250 units/L were essentially normal while WBC was elevated to 14,900 cells/L. An attempt to correct metabolic disturbances using crystalloids helped manage her symptoms until surgical evaluation for probable gallbladder disease could take place. Upon evaluation prior to surgery it appears she required close observation to correct potential electrolyte imbalances.",

The history of present illness began several days prior to admission, when the patient developed a cough, initially mildly productive of clear phlegm. She attributed her illness to exhaustion, having recently undertaken significant additional professional commitments, which left her managing a heavy workload. However, her condition rapidly deteriorated as the cough became more productive and discolored and she experienced an increasing high spiking fever, prompting an urgent clinic visit.\n\nThe patient's past medical history includes controlled asthma since childhood and migraines. There is no prior significant hospitalization, and her allergies include codeine and iodine. Medications included an albuterol inhaler as needed and occasional use of triptans for acute migraine management. Despite smoking one package a week about 25 years prior, she quit after the birth of her first child about a dozen years ago.\n\nSocially, the patient enjoys active living but admits the pressures at home due to caring for a parent with dementia made her neglect personal health recently. Physical examination findings on initial hospital admission included diminished air entry at lung bases with dullness suggestive of lobar consolidation, mild conjunctival erythema, pulse was about 100/min and was somewhat irregular on admission. The patient also reported that after the initial visit with an urgent care physician her oxygen saturation levels plummeted during transportation from emergency medical technician, but after quick adjustment with an oxymizer by an oxygen concentrator by the transport paramedic, there was recovery.\n\nFurther examination was initiated including imaging and comprehensive analysis which was reviewed from laboratory data, showing acute bacterial pneumonia, which supported an initial presumptive assessment. The radiological images confirmed bilateral, lobar involvement but also hinted on an infiltrative disease that seemed slightly unusual for a simple pneumonia, suggesting either atypical bacteria or additional factors like a foreign object in the trach from when she used her home nebulizer which seemed faulty prior her worsening cough but could be excluded in imaging.\n\nDuring her admission she received aggressive respiratory and oxygen delivery, and was initiated empirically on intravenous beta-lactams and was noted in initial hours, experiencing malfunction of her intravenous line pump which needed rapid nurse intervention as well was later changed and was started on quinolone when further testing indicated more of an atypical origin or component, and later also developed some concern over possible hospital-acquired Clostridiom, given the sudden worsening on a fourth-generation cephalop with anaero and MRSA as coverage. Monitoring throughout revealed that her respiratory failure resolved, while managing other secondary issues that had emerged.\n\nUpon a successful, although complicated hospital course marked with challenges related to an oxygen delivery system malfunction and managing the implications of potential Clostridiom acquisition from a likely hospital source while trying not to escalate the medication side-effects she has experienced some setbacks, however, was later found clinically fit to resume low-stress living with outpatient care after two hospital weeks in care after an initially challenging, life-changing recovery from her illness of severe lower-lobe infiltrative pneumonia with some complications of respiratory and infectious issues likely interplayed during management of this disease course that was made somewhat more perilous as complications arose due to malfunction of medical devices.",

As his fluid loss progressed, despite efforts by family members to administer oral hydration, he began displaying altered mental status which significantly worsened upon arrival.\n\nPast Medical History: \nThe patient had multiple past medical conditions such as asthma, treated with inhaled corticosteroids, and hypertension, for which he has been diligently taking beta blockers and diuretics without issues. A surgical device is implanted in his ankle to support a severe fibular fracture suffered during a sporting accident five years ago. He also experiences chronic back pain, which his primary care provider had been managing.\n\nSocial History: \nHe reported a stressful job that involved regular, extensive travel and working outdoors in hot environments, and was married to a dietician. This combination allowed for healthy dietary options, yet, in recent months, he had begun smoking up to five cigarettes daily due to work pressures, representing an increased health risk factor.\n\nPhysical Examination: \nFindings revealed dryness in the oral orifice, significant tachycardia reaching up to a hundred beats per minute, decreased consciousness on Glasgow scale upon admission, low grade fever that later rose sharply as hospital stay progressed and significant orthostatic drop, indicative of low circulating blood volume and thus validating initial suspicions.\n\nLaboratory Data: \nThe blood examination upon emergency room registration reflected very high levels of waste accumulation that indicate poor kidney clearance as reflected in lab studies such creatinine and urea which stood elevated by factors of four and six, signaling that kidney damage may have reached critical phase.\n\nHospital Course: \nAfter administering adequate doses of intravenous hydration therapy alongside close nephrologist observation due to potential medication impact to the kidneys function while on certain diuretics therapy which required prompt discontinuance until acute issues stabilize. Also careful handling and follow-ups concerning device management post-surgical operation and ensuring its normal operation during entire period helped prevent any potential device impact.",

She denied any prior episodes of similar symptoms but mentioned feeling slightly more fatigued than usual in the previous week. \n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY\nThe patient's past medical history is notable for well-controlled diabetes mellitus type II, for which she takes metformin daily, and chronic osteoarthritis of the knees. She underwent right knee replacement surgery two years ago and has been off work since then, enjoying her retirement. She is otherwise physically active, regularly walking her dog and practicing yoga twice a week.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\nThe patient smokes one pack of cigarettes a week, having significantly reduced her smoking habit over the years since her initial diagnosis of diabetes. She enjoys a low-alcohol beer occasionally, typically with her husband during Sundays. The couple lives in a second-floor apartment, necessitating occasional use of the elevator due to the patient's knee issues.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\nUpon admission, the patient was anxious but fully awake, able to describe her pain clearly. Her blood pressure was elevated at 165/88 mmHg, and her pulse was racing at 108 beats per minute. A significant physical finding was the tenderness along the medial aspect of her chest wall, not typical of myocardial infraction-related pain, but possibly related to recent increases in physical activity such as gardening which the patient recently undertook for relaxation.\n\nLABORATORY DATA\nInitial laboratory evaluation included a serum troponin level, which was notably higher than anticipated given her clinical condition of suspected myocardial infarction, likely indicating significant injury to the myocardium. Also found was mildly impaired liver function as shown by slightly elevated transaminase levels, possibly attributable to chronic alcohol usage.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE\nAdministration of standard acute myocardial infarction treatment to thirty-year-old emergency room physician's patient surprisingly resulted in a mild unexpected allergic reaction to thrombolytics used to dissolve blood clots, indicating this treatment might not work for the middle-aged lawyer, so doctors changed it. The anticoagulation treatment that the elderly diabetic took led them to bleed much more excessively as the treatment interacted with diabetes. Following the thrombolytic therapy withdrawal due to allergy, and the commencement of a heparin-based anticoagulation therapy with close monitoring in our Intensive Care Unit, the patient began to stabilize within eighteen hours and her condition eventually resolved with further hospital stay for careful cardiac health assessment to ensure her full recovery, thereby avoiding potentially critical consequences.",

Additionally, the family mentions the patient experienced fever that has partially resolved after taking over-the-counter medications. The symptoms have also been impacting the patent's ability to keep up with day-to-day personal care activities. Due to increasing distress, the patient sought acute care services where emergency physicians evaluated signs suggestive of possible pneumonia. Prior to presentation, the individual remained active, albeit not consistently exercising, in part due to knee osteoarthritis.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY \nThe patient has notable past medical histories including essential hypertension controlled with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and spironolactone, along with chronic systolic heart failure, type 2 diabetes for which the patient uses metformin as treatment and experiences periodic elevation of blood pressure and blood glucose which are monitored through clinic visits.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY \nA non-smoker and very light-drinking female living at home with family. Patient is generally mobile and has been relatively able-bodied despite experiencing some level of discomfort in her osteoarthritic joints, with her current knee condition under management.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION \nOn arrival the patient's clinical examination demonstrated clear lung fields with some wheezing noted in auscultation, jugular venous pressure elevated at 8cm suggesting possible increased venous return pressure in context of the patient's symptoms of worsening exertional capacity, an S3 ventricular gallop with displaced cardiac borders. Systolic murmurs and diminished peripheral pulses suggest worsening circulatory efficiency possibly secondary to exacerbation and chronic comorbidities complicating this picture.\n\nLABORATORY DATA \nInitial lab results are consistent with mild renal insufficiency with the serum creatinine elevated mildly. Also noted a very mild troponin elevation. These test results were used for guiding the patient's fluid management and cardiovascular interventions during treatment for exacerbation. Oxygen requirement for this patient on arrival was significant with saturations at room air below ninety.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE \nCaregivers monitored closely fluid volume status with careful use and adjustment of both the rate and net balance given concerns with patient comfort and clinical findings. Cardiac care specialists reviewed the echocardiograph for ventricular strain indicating a possibility the patient was retaining water secondary to medication use and advised adjustments to therapy targeting optimal loading conditions and improved heart pump efficiency to mitigate further exacerbation, particularly targeting volume status.

ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS was made at the emergency department as delirium, with an unclear etiology upon initial evaluation.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS started two days prior to admission, when the family noticed marked alterations in her mental status, disorientation to time and space, as well as marked memory impairment. Initially, it was thought that this could be related to her chronic benzodiazepine use for management of anxiety, possibly exacerbated by a recent hip surgery.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY was significant for arthritis, managed with NSAIDs, long-standing hypertension that is under control with lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide, as well as early-stage Alzheimer's disease, which had been stable for a considerable period. Her regular medications also included low-dose oxazepam, a sedative used to control anxiety during periods of heightened stress. It is worth noting that in her medical records, there had been occasions where oxazepam triggered paradoxical reactions, with this particular occasion marked by notable exacerbation.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY revealed Mrs Johnson as a widow who lived alone in a well-equipped house with family visits three times a week. She does enjoy activities in her local garden society but has noticed a significant decline in her physical abilities. There has been minimal use of other forms of central nervous system-acting drugs or substances apart from the mentioned prescriptions.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION noted that she had a high fever and low-grade respiratory sounds that indicated likely pneumonia. The remainder of her physical exam, including cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal systems, was largely unremarkable. Her neurological examination revealed signs suggestive of confusion with periods of extreme agitation for which she needed to be restraints applied and was started on low-dose lorazepam to mitigate these symptoms despite her previous record of a benzodiazepine-induced paradoxical reaction to other sedatives in her profile, indicating this class is best minimized. The paradoxical reaction that involved significant episodes of disinhibition was carefully monitored and discussed with her family due to concern of her sedative response and overall safety while medicated.\n\nLABORATORY DATA revealed slightly deranged liver enzymes potentially due to antibiotic exposure and signs indicating urinary tract infection was also likely in combination with a chest X-ray confirming left lower lobe pneumonia. Full work-up also identified a significantly diminished WBC which pointed toward further sepitec shock management need alongside antibiotics. These lab analyses have greatly directed Mrs Johnson's course of care with her condition now managed effectively with the removal from the offending antibiotic alongside the management of all other identified problems including discontinuing the potentially causative or worsening agent for the paradoxical reactions from previous similar exposures noted within medical documentation that have guided decision at the present time.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE proceeded uneventfully upon appropriate antibiotics being initiated, resolution of fever, improvement of pneumonia, as well proper sedation using non-benzodiazepine-based methods under rigorous supervision and with input from both the families. It became apparent to both family member\u2019s satisfaction and medical personnel involved, upon discontinuating causative benzodiazepinemedications alongside appropriate alternatives being considered, her acute mental symptoms greatly resolved pointing positively toward her recovery phase now directed well from all noted findings from lab data alongside proper treatment implementation as identified early within Mrs Johnson\u2019s management at hospital with final followup indicating great progress in her general well being and",

Prior to this illness, she enjoyed good health but mentioned several high-profile performances in dusty environments in the past few weeks.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY\nThe patient has a remarkable past medical history significant for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anesthesia several years ago, which was followed by a somewhat prolonged recovery characterized by fatigue and mild respiratory issues. She has also had multiple vocal cord surgeries due to recurrent polypoiditis. Her allergy history notable mentions sulfa drugs, causing a skin rash, and a severe allergy to penicillin. The patient is not a smoker but occasionally consumes alcoholic beverages during special events.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\nThis individual resides alone and has a network of colleagues in various artistic disciplines. Despite her demanding career requiring frequent air travel and irregular schedules, she follows a fairly rigorous health regimen which includes yoga and meditation as stress reduction measures. Concerning her diet, the patient adheres predominantly to vegetarian principles.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\nOn physical examination, she exhibited tender cervical lymphadenopathy, and examination with a tongue depressor noted swelling and erythema of the base of her tongue area and the arytenoids, raising suspicion for her underlying condition.\n\nLABORATORY DATA\nPertinent results indicated marked elevation in white blood counts with neutrophili, consistent with an acute bacterial infection. The patient's erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was found to be markedly elevated. Computed tomography imaging was suggestive of a significantly involved airway with substantial risk for rapid clinical degradation and potential airway compromise.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE\nThe immediate priority was securing an uncomplicated airway, necessitating a procedure under monitored anesthesia care with careful spontaneous ventilation anesthesia for her endotracheal intubation. A prolonged recovery under anesthesia was anticipated for the patient, due to potential irritation caused to the vocal cords during manipulation and existing inflammation. Despite these complexities, airway stabilization was successfully managed with antibiotic treatments, pain management protocol, supportive care, and the assistance of speech pathology to facilitate healing, thereby resulting in resolution without the development of any lasting complications or necessity for a longer-term care transition post-recovery from prolonged general inhalation agent induced recovery.",

Notably, the patient is on warfarin for long-term anticoagulation due to his past medical history of atrial fibrillation with an estimated risk score for stroke high enough to warrant such therapy. The social history revealed a nonsmoker, but the patient had been exposed to significant amounts of asbestos during his career, has occasional alcohol intake limited to a few beers during holiday gatherings, and is a widower who lives with one of his daughters who looks after his basic needs but allows him independence.\n\nPhysical examination found him oriented in all three spheres but exhibited clear dysarthric speech and profound weakness (graded at about 2 out of 5 on the left upper and lower limbs), suggesting an area on the right side of his brain as the possible origin of this stroke event. A head CT was performed immediately given the patient's anticoagulation status for possible hemorrhage, and laboratory data showed the elevated international normalized ratio consistent with effective warfarin anticoagulation as evidenced also by PT values at over double expected, indicating that an intracranial hemorrhage rather than ischemia had caused his deficits as suspected given warfarin therapy's potential to contribute significantly to the risk and size if an intra-cerberal bleed was to develop.\n\n\nThe CT result confirming a sizable right sided cerebral bleeds' intravenous anticonvulsant therapy given for potential risk of induced clinical seizure, along neuro-intersivenist, input given, management also includes stat dose vitamin k administered alongside activated charcoal per stomach empty given need reverse, anticoag status emergeny situation.\n\n\nA complex interplay of management options including potential surgery to decompress the intracranial pressures that may threaten life or long-term brain recovery given the severity.

Her spouse reported that she had decreased oral intake and limited mobility over the past month, taking furosemide 40mg daily as per her doctor's advice for long-standing peripheral edema. Despite this, her renal symptoms worsened. Over the past 48 hours, she experienced a dry mouth, dark yellow urine, and worsening confusion, prompting family members to bring her to the emergency room.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY\nThe patient's medical records indicate a complex mix of chronic diseases including hypertension, dyslipidemia, osteoarthritis, diabetes mellitus type II, and a past deep vein thrombosis in her left leg, for which she takes aspirin 81mg, atorvastatin 20mg, glipizide 5mg, lisinopril 10mg, and Coumadin for anticoagulation. \n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\nThe patient resides with her husband and daughter, who provide daily living assistance as her activities of daily living have become compromised due to mobility issues. A devoted grandmother, the patient engages in hobbies including knitting, reading historical texts, and participating in monthly art history classes online when her eyes and health permit.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\nUpon examination, her skin exhibits signs of dehydration - including dry lips, decreased skin turgor, and significant orthostatic changes - and her abdomen was mildly tendous with no other palpable masses observed on thorough palpation. Cardiovascular assessment yielded normal first and second heart sounds with minimal rate and respiratory variation of intensity noted without any third heart sounds observed on examination. Initial assessment by neurology noted significant slowing on non-dominant parietal cortical area likely a result of mild volume contraction and the effects of severe dehydration, which was managed accordingly on follow-up.\n\nLABORATORY DATA\nThe most critical findings include a severe disturbance of her serum electrolytes (sodium at 138mmol/L, chloride 105mmol/L and serum phosphorus was noted at significantly less than expected). Initial serum creatinine showed moderate elevations indicating likely prerenal azotemia, prompting intravenous rehydration using half normal saline with monitoring of electrolyte disturbances particularly serum potassium where our elderly patient received significant amounts of potassium supplement given her chronic long term administration of furosemide. \n\nHOSPITAL COURSE\nDuring her admission, her creatinine improved and returned to baseline indicating successful treatment of dehydration and subsequent correction of acute kidney injury through adequate replenishment of the intravascular volume. Electrolytes also showed significant correction after rehydration and replacement particularly of potassium after which she experienced some resolution of the neuromuscular symptoms. After three days of monitoring, she was deemed stable enough to be discharged with recommendations for adequate fluids, dietary instructions on foods to maintain healthy serum sodium and close follow up visits.

Mr Smith has a significant past medical history including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ischaemic heart disease requiring a pacemaker, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and a traumatic brain injury from a motor vehicle accident twenty five years ago that has left him with persistent difficulties with his memory.\n\nIn social terms Mr Smith lived alone and enjoyed long solo walks in the countryside but he is struggling to give up his lifelong love of cigars following his last major exacerbation of chronic obstructive airways disease. His alcohol consumption has however significantly reduced in the last five months. A review of his current medications reveals metformin, perindopril and tiotropium.\n\nA physical examination by Dr Lee on admission revealed an extremely dehydrated patient who exhibited clinical signs consistent with infection and a pacemaker with its lead displacing through scarred cardiac tissue and into the adjacent pericardial space which was confirmed using his current cardiac monitor which uses data from an older but fully functional pacemaker attached in this position to an existing sternal lead.\n\nIn terms of the results the admission chest x ray appeared relatively unchanged but full laboratory evaluation including electrolytes indicated severe renal impairment with elevated urea to Creatinine, alongside significantly raised inflammatory markers pointing towards his urinary sepsis diagnosis being very likely indeed and the elevated C-Reactive protein confirmed that there had been significant inflammation occurring somewhere within his system, all which correlated well with the patient symptoms as described during the initial clinical consultations on his initial day Mr Smith subsequently underwent flexible cystoscopy and midstream Specimen Of his Urine which confirmed a lower urinary tract infection being present.\n\nMr Smith then had a urinary catheter inserted and subsequently spent seven uneventful nights within general medical beds where treatment including high volume rehydration intravenous antibiotics were started which resulted in gradual resolution of the sepsis alongside a full normalization of all renal and inflammatory indices as he also eventually recovered full normal sensation and power in his bladder muscles which allowed removal and eventual safe catheterless passage of normal concentrated urine once the entire medical teams review was entirely completed and also a review undertaken with his family regarding further ongoing community treatment as an out inpatient which included continuation antibiotic courses to completely treat and clear his confirmed infections along the whole urinary pathway, the cardiologist and renal specialist were fully in agreement regarding further action after reviewing his post discharge pacemaker lead displacement.",

However, she notes their recent significant increase in severity and frequency since the COVID-19 pandemic began, attributing the exacerbation to changes in her routine, heightened levels of stress, and the physical constraints of prolonged mask-wearing when stepping out of her home. The frequency evolved from once every one to two months to three to four episodes weekly, severely impacting her quality of life. She also admitted to relying increasingly on a combination of over-the-counter medications, which she fears may exacerbate her condition.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY\nThis patient has a past medical history significant for osteoporosis, managed with a weekly bisphosphonate, and long-standing essential hypertension controlled through diet, exercise, and calcium channel blocker monotherapy. Notable is her history of deep vein thrombosis treated in the distant past with oral anticoagulation, which posed no major challenges with respect to the potential use of novel oral anti-migraine treatments that can carry potential hematologic concerns such as serotonin syndrome when concomitantly administered with her existing anti-depressant.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\nA non-smoker, she rarely consumes alcohol but does report an active and socially fulfilling life despite limitations since the pandemic. A widowed grandmother, she stays involved with a local community center helping with remote learning projects for area youth, thus staying digitally literate despite her advanced age. This fulfilling schedule, disrupted by migraine frequency, motivated aggressive intervention.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\nGeneral physical examination, aside from blood pressure of 155/92 mmHg that needed re-emphasis on home measurements as well as better adherence with recommended low dose exercise activity schedule adjustment, revealed a non-distressed albeit apprehensive lady with full range of movement in muscles of face and extremities, all cranial nerves tested intact, no gross motor weakness, and absence of focal neurological signs or any acute deficits indicating the headaches to likely remain primary versus secondary from detectable pathology.\n\nLABORATORY DATA\nInitial screening blood test results were largely normal aside from expected elevated erythrocyte magnesium due to supplement consumption started independently. MRI of the brain conducted during this stay did demonstrate scattered foci suggesting chronic microangiopathy with several lacunae without shift of calcification in areas known to affect motor strength, further corroborating absence of clear alternative diagnoses.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE\nThe patient had trials on several preventive and therapeutic interventions throughout the hospital stay to help control migraine. Notable inclusion due to her severe, drug-refractory status included experimental administration of a novel subcutaneously administered drug called Atogepant, designed to block at the CGRP pathway to hopefully offer a novel option for those patients such as our patient refractory to conventional treatments. Despite initial hesitation to partake in \"experimental medicine\" her willingness in light of the substantial potential quality life benefits was notable and her consent after full discussion documented, laying a pathway ahead with follow-up clinic plans arranged for her subsequent evaluation in one month for further observation of potential efficacy",

He also has chronic low back pain and uses oxycontin and ibuprofen as needed, but has been experiencing withdrawal symptoms since arriving at the hospital, thus fentanyl was considered for pain management. On social history, it was revealed that he uses heroin occasionally, smokes a pack of cigarettes a day, uses alcohol on social occasions but rarely to binge, does not consume fruits but is an avid meat eater.\n\nUpon physical examination, he appears acutely ill with severe midline abdominal tenderness to the epigastric region. There is significant right-sided costovertebral tenderness consistent with radiculopathy. An abdominal ultrasound indicates the probable cause for the pancreatitis could be cholelithiasis. An MRI of the lumbar spine to rule out metastatic cancer causing cord compression from possible pancreatitis related radiculopathy, and endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography will likely be performed after stabilization.\n\n Laboratory data from initial labs indicates elevated blood levels for total and direct bilirubin, leukocytosis with a significant bandshift suggestive of an infectious process, as well as a severely raised pancreatic lipase of more than seven times normal and mild derangement of his coagulation markers. Arterial blood gas reveals mild metabolic acidosis as suggested by low bicarbonate.\n\nDuring hospital course, after undergoing the procedure of ERCP, propofol was used as the sedation and the procedure was technically satisfactory but the patient experienced respiratory depression post op as a complication, requiring brief mechanical ventilation, after which midazolam infusion provided adequate ongoing analgesia without further complications. Following adequate control of his pain with intravenous hydromorphone as necessary as an immediate measure following cessation of his sedative regimen from the ERCP the rest of the recovery went well for the patient. He will start a bowel movement rehabilitation after an oral diet of bland foods is started. A pain management and gastro specialist will be needed upon discharge to assess the feasibility for follow on cholecystectomy for gallstone removal as well as for addressing and managing chronic low back symptoms for which gabapentin use will now be necessary.",

Upon admission, she was found to have an oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. \n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS \nOne week prior to admission, the patient developed a cough and mild fever, which she managed at home with over-the-counter acetaminophen. As her condition worsened over time, she began to experience pronounced fatigue and a significant decline in her ability to perform daily activities due to dyspnea. Her cough gradually increased in severity, producing small amounts of clear sputum.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY \nThe patient has a history of mild COPD and osteoarthritis. She takes inhaled fluticasone as maintenance therapy for COPD. Her medication regimen also includes lisinopril for blood pressure management and omeprazole as needed to alleviate mild gastritis symptoms she occasionally experiences, particularly with NSAIDs. In her 50s, she was treated for breast cancer, receiving surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Given her history of osteoarthritis, her orthopedic specialist sometimes recommends she undergo certain pain management procedures, although in recent times she has declined considering any type of procedure due to her concern over needing sedation during hospitalization.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY \nThe patient retired seven years ago and has been an ex-smoker for over two decades. After retiring, she became more active, joining various gardening clubs and participating in light aerobics to alleviate her arthritis symptoms. Though her smoking cessation significantly lowered her pulmonary risks compared to when she smoked, COPD symptoms and disease progression still posed notable challenges.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION \nOn initial presentation, her lungs exhibited decreased air sounds upon auscultation, suggestive of obstructive patterns consistent with her disease history. There was mild bilateral leg edema.\n\nLABORATORY DATA \nChest X-ray on admission indicated probable pneumonia given bilateral infiltrates and an elevated white blood cell count, suggesting an ongoing infectious process.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE \nGiven her worsening symptomatology, treatment included starting systemic corticosteroids to alleviate bronchospasm along with broad-spectrum antibiotics for likely community-acquired pneumonia. Throughout her hospital course, respiratory therapy involved several sessions daily, utilizing treatments tailored to improve lung capacity, and as she began showing signs of improving, a gentle weaning from more continuous monitoring to intermittent began. Despite a complex clinical scenario at admission, the multidisciplinary approach led by respiratory and general medicine helped the patient to recover substantially, enabling eventual safe discharge.",

He was experiencing breakthrough back pain despite using his as-directed fentanyl patches and Percocet pills as had been prescribed for management of such exacerbations by his primary care doctor. On day five, his primary caregiver left town, and his pain levels sharply increased; feeling desperate, Robert made two poor choices. First, in addition to applying an excessive number of fentanyl patches to his lower back simultaneously (a decision aimed at accelerating opioid analgesic delivery), Robert then proceeded with unsupervised, self-administered increments of his Percocet, exceeding a quadrupling of dosage recommendations as advised on each respective bottle labeling from pharmacy dispensing for acute episodes management per prior instruction.\n\nAs for his past medical history, Robert had suffered an array of physically demanding, injury-prone years on construction projects which cumulatively contributed significant musculoskeletal problems alongside resultant analgesic requirement elevations, but importantly Robert also suffers a co-occurrent medical burden of diagnosed hypercholesterolemia for which atorvastatin is regularly prescribed. \n\nRobert's social history was uneventful. Being divorced for over fifteen years, he led a simple, routine-dominated lifestyle.

Initially, the symptoms were mild, but they deteriorated over time. The patient tried to manage the symptoms at home with over-the-counter medications until the onset of severe shortness of breath, at which point she sought emergency medical attention.\n\nThe patient's past medical history is significant for hypertension, diabetes type 2, and a past myocardial infarction two years prior. She has been managed on a combination of metformin, atenolol, aspirin, and enalapril for these conditions by her primary care doctor. She has a 30-pack-year smoking history but quit ten years ago. Her family history is relevant for coronary artery disease.\n\nRegarding her social history, except for quitting smoking a decade ago, the patient's lifestyle habits haven't significantly changed.

Chest exam findings indicated coarse breath sounds bilaterally, more so in the lower lobes, suggesting consolidation compatible with multifocal pneumonia. Examination of the cardiovascular system showed mild congestive heart failure signs.\n\nLaboratory data upon admission showed leukocytosis with left shift, a significant reduction in PaO2 on arterial blood gas, hyperglycemia at 190 mg/dl, and mildly elevated serum creatinine. Chest X-ray findings confirmed extensive infiltrates in both lungs consistent with multifocal pneumonia.\n\nThe hospital course was marked by initial support with noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, aggressive IV hydration, empirical antibiotics for treatment of suspected secondary bacterial infection, and closer monitoring on the step-down unit due to underlying cardiac history and potential risks of rapid fluid overload exacerbating congestive heart failure. Despite showing signs of slight clinical improvement with this treatment regimen, it remains essential to monitor her disease progression closely and tailor the medical intervention correspondingly to maximize recovery chances, highlighting once more the influenza vaccination's ineffectiveness in the context of this case due to age-related immunosenescence.",

    "record": "The twenty-eight-year-old landscape designer was admitted with a primary diagnosis of dehydration and kidney damage, necessitating close monitoring and supportive care. Her hospital encounter began with complaints of dark-colored urine and severe flank pain, gradually becoming worse over the course of six days. She had been on methotrexate to control her recently diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis. The landscape designer reported a history of excessive NSAID usage for chronic back pain due to her physical work schedule prior to switching to methotrexate, and upon hospitalization, cyclophosphamide therapy was promptly discontinued due to concerns of further methotrexate cyclophosphamide toxicity, to potentially mitigate her methotrexate renal toxicity.\n\nThe patient has a notable history, apart from her rheumatoid arthritis being diagnosed four months earlier. Her medical chart also indicates well-controlled hypertension on lisinopril and recent treatment for a kidney infection, which was complicated and prolonged. As a smoker for seven years with an occasional recreational drinker lifestyle and history of smoking-related cough in winter months, she is encouraged to minimize these factors which impact health. The absence of known family kidney issues was a favorable prognostic sign. On a broader scale, an understanding of family disease dynamics offers insights beyond her present condition towards better preventive and management guidance on overall long term well-being. The twenty-eight-year-old lives at home along with one sibling who currently remains unaffected according to patient verbal communication, but given family ties her concern is also to help maintain an active dialogue among household members in managing shared genetic related vulnerabilities and health risks as she learns to manage her condition more thoroughly.\n\n\nPhysical examination during admission showed mild fever with significant reduction in urine output and an uncomfortable lower lumbar region to gentle pressure but nothing indicative of severe organ displacement that may signal impending complications beyond acute damage now. The results show low serum creatinine but a trend increase, indicating mild renal impairment consistent with her cyclophosphamide methotrexate related potential renal damage risk that has been heightened due to prior long durations of analgesic NSAID usage in unmonitored amounts.\n\n\nThe patient underwent several laboratory tests including serum creatinine to gauge renal capabilities which confirmed renal toxicity that had started from chronic NSAID over-intake which got complicated with prescribed methotrexate therapy further impacting kidney efficiency, compelling cyclophosphamide and NSAID discontinuance, for recovery prioritizing a cyclophosphamide free regime while introducing safer alternatives to minimize kidney damage risk and avoid potential acute severe kidney renal impairment as methotrexate cyclophosphamide side effects were observed upon this hospitalization incident due its severe toxicity in susceptible patients.\n\n\nOn the fifth evening, patient was put under cyclophosphamide replacement therapies due to cyclophosphamide causing methotrexate related complications like cyclophosphamide cyclophosphamide methotrexate synergistically increasing overall risks including that posed from NSAID usage patterns leading her renal toxicity as well resulting subsequent discontinuation to avert her from cyclophosphamide or even analgesic methotrexate induced long lasting injury on kidney function recovery and cyclophosphamide and the methotrexate cyclophosphamide free cyclophosphamide renal system safety measures and guidelines during cyclophosphamide therapy for managing methotrexate renal side effects.",

Initial management at home consisted of over-the-counter cough medication. However, her condition worsened, prompting a visit to her primary care provider, who subsequently recommended hospitalization for further workup and treatment given the patient's history of COPD.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY \nThe patient has a medical history significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and mild liver disease secondary to long-standing hepatitis B. Her chronic medical management includes tiotropium inhaler and intermittent use of antibiotics for episodes of exacerbated COPD. Prior admissions for COPD exacerbations included treatment that once led to drug induced liver injury necessitating cessation of that particular medication.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY \nShe is married, lives with her wife, and has two daughters. Her social history is notable for a thirty-year-history of smoking, although she has cut down on this significantly in the past decade, reporting fewer than five cigarettes a week currently. Her diet is reportedly healthy, albeit with higher salt intake due to family recipe preferences.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION \nUpon physical exam, the patient appeared to be somewhat underweight. The lung fields revealed rales bilaterally, more profound on the right side, suggesting infiltrates. Cardiac exam showed no obvious defects but had signs of mild peripheral edema bilaterally at both extremities, possibly a complication of medication therapy that she was using prior.\n\nLABORATORY DATA \nLab analysis revealed significantly elevated inflammatory markers, including a C-reactive protein level, mild leukocytosis with elevated neutrophilia, suggesting infection. An arterial blood gas on low flow showed a slight decrease in her oxygen, necessitating initial therapy with nasal O2. Her renal function panel was within the limits of her long-standing history of disease with only mild elevation of serum creatinine levels at or below levels seen at admission one month prior to another hospital.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE \nDuring the hospital course, respiratory physiotherapy alongside intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics was used to manage her condition due to the potential development of respiratory problems that can include toxic drug levels when certain combinations of medications are used, in combination her medical condition and long-term drug abuse. This included intravenous treatment for managing pain and hydration management. Upon significant and continuous respiratory therapy, patient oxygen requirements started to reduce, her sputum cleared and she became fully mobile before transfer on sixth Hospital day for long term care in specialized rehabilitation unit, for recovery as required to prevent relapse upon hospital dis charge",

    "record": "ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS\nThe patient was admitted with a diagnosis of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus prosthesis-related infection, which likely originated from a prosthetic knee replacement the patient had undergone five years ago.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\nThe patient is an eighty-year-old retired machinist, who presented to our emergency department with complaints of increasing knee pain and redness around his prosthesis over the past two weeks. He reported having had fever intermittently during this period, and experienced difficulties with ambulation. The patient had also noticed some increased fluid accumulation and a foul odor at the surgical site. Despite having a knee replacement five years ago, this recent issue seemed out of the ordinary and prompted the patient's concerned grandchildren, who work as medical professionals, to urge him to seek medical attention. Upon being fitted with a knee prosthesis and having a subsequent pacemaker implant three years ago, the knee implant was noted to be in need of monitoring due to a history of superficial skin infections, including cellulitis that required hospitalizations and long antibiotic treatments in the past.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY\nIn addition to having an implanted pacemaker and knee prosthesis, the patient is a heavy smoker and has a significant past medical history. This include severe peripheral vascular disease causing chronic leg ulcers and chronic low back pain from years of repetitive labor in machinery environments, for which the patient has required physical rehabilitation and long term medications which included methadone for severe neuropathic back pain and pentoxifylline. The patient also suffered two previous transient ischemic attacks. These significant histories likely placed this elderly male at increased risk for postoperative complications as well having recurrent infections. \n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\nSocial history noted reveals that our patient has been living alone since his wife passed several months prior, relies largely on his grandchildren who reside within an hour commute of the house for all his needs and has struggled since with issues stemming depression as noted his psychiatrist.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\nExam on arrival found patient in moderate distress on account a painful gait noted to ambulate only very briefly. Local wound exam at the prosthetic knee shows  6cm x 2cm surgical wound with signs of purulent drainage around edges and swelling at that particular location that appeared severely inflamed to both visual evaluation and to palpation.\n\nLABORATORY DATA\nBlood cultures confirmed MRSA bacteria and complete metabolic profile along an erythrocyte sedimentation rate were notably elevated at >130 and CRP at 150. Knee fluid aspirate analysis confirmed purulent fluid presence. \n\nHOSPITAL COURSE\nOur eighty-year-old retired machinist underwent operative debridement of prosthetic knee joint along subsequent six weeks of MRSA targeted antibiotic infusion under direct in home therapy and wound management under careful monitoring. The patient also began a tailored plan in physical therapy for increasing the strength back into his atrophied lower limbs as well his general balance issues secondary the prothetic implant infection, as per our inpatient physio department to maximize mobility with a prosthetic knee which should allow adequate function to eventually get his pre-infection functionality level back once healed. The overall outcome, in this patient, was a favorable response in terms symptoms, wound recovery and blood parameter recovery despite his multifactor and challenging medical situation.  Patient's postoperative pain control with use oral medications has remained well managed as evaluated. He will need follow up and close monitoring",
