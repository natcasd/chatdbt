    "record": "ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: The patient, a 72-year-old retired high school teacher, was admitted with an acute ischemic stroke.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient was brought to the emergency room by her daughter after experiencing sudden weakness on the right side of her body and slurred speech. These events began abruptly at 3 PM, approximately two hours before arriving at the hospital. There was no loss of consciousness or seizure activity noted. Upon arrival at the ER, neurological examinations and imaging confirmed the diagnosis of a left middle cerebral artery stroke.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient has a history of hypertension for the past 20 years, managed with lisinopril. She also has atrial fibrillation for which she has been on warfarin. Notably, her INR levels have been difficult to maintain within the therapeutic range. She has a past history of transient ischemic attack five years ago, with no residual deficits following that event. She also has hyperlipidemia, for which she takes atorvastatin.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with her husband and remains highly active in her community, volunteering at a local library. She is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol occasionally, primarily when dining out. She has two grown children and frequently enjoys gardening in her spare time.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On examination, the patient was alert but had noticeable expressive aphasia. Right-sided hemiparesis was present, with decreased strength graded at 2/5 in the right upper and lower limbs. Her blood pressure was elevated at 180/100 mmHg. Heart auscultation revealed an irregularly irregular rhythm, consistent with atrial fibrillation. Lungs were clear, and no carotid bruits were detected.\n\nLABORATORY DATA: Key laboratory findings included hemoglobin of 13.5 g/dL, INR of 1.5, creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, and total cholesterol of 210 mg/dL. A CT scan of the head showed early signs of ischemia in the left hemisphere, consistent with an acute ischemic stroke.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE: Upon confirmation of an acute ischemic stroke, the patient was promptly treated with intravenous thrombolysis, as she presented within the therapeutic window. Her symptoms showed partial improvement, particularly in speech, with reduction in aphasia. She was monitored in the ICU for 24 hours following thrombolysis for any conversion to hemorrhagic stroke, during which time she remained stable.\n\nPost-ICU care included the adjustment of her warfarin dosage to achieve a therapeutic INR. A cardiology consult was obtained for optimization of her atrial fibrillation management. The patient was later transferred to a stroke rehabilitation unit where she actively participated in daily physical therapy sessions. The rehabilitation focus included improving mobility, speech therapy for language deficits, and occupational therapy for functional tasks.\n\nBy discharge, the patient demonstrated significant gains in her physical abilities, moving independently with a walker, and had substantial improvement in her speech. A comprehensive discharge plan was established, including outpatient follow-up with neurology and cardiology, and continued rehabilitation sessions. The patient's family members were educated about stroke recognition and prevention to prevent future episodes.",

Initially, he developed a dry cough and low-grade fever, which he attributed to seasonal changes. However, over the past two days, his cough has become productive with greenish sputum, and he has experienced dyspnea upon exertion and at rest. He denies any chest pain but notes a persistent fatigue.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Mr. Hargrove has a history of hypertension, which is well-controlled with medication. He also has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, diagnosed five years ago, for which he takes metformin. There is no known history of coronary artery disease or previous hospitalizations for respiratory illnesses. He reports an allergy to penicillin, which results in hives.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY: Mr. Hargrove is a retired high school teacher who lives alone. He is a former smoker, having quit 10 years ago after a 40 pack-year smoking history. He moderates his alcohol intake, with an occasional glass of wine with dinner.

Vital signs showed a temperature of 101.5\u00b0F, blood pressure of 138/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. Lung auscultation revealed crackles in the right lower lobe, consistent with consolidation. The cardiovascular examination was unremarkable, with a regular rate and rhythm and no murmurs.\n\nLABORATORY DATA: Initial laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14,500/mcL, elevated C-reactive protein, and normal hemoglobin and platelet count. A chest x-ray demonstrated right lower lobe infiltrate, consistent with pneumonia. Blood cultures were obtained, and sputum culture and sensitivity were sent to the laboratory.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE: Mr. Hargrove was admitted to the hospital and started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin as empirical treatment for community-acquired pneumonia. Due to his penicillin allergy, alternative antibiotics were selected to avoid cross-reactivity. Supplemental oxygen was provided via nasal cannula to maintain his oxygen saturation above 92%. Over the course of the first 48 hours in the hospital, Mr. Hargrove showed significant improvement in his respiratory symptoms with decreased cough and improved breath sounds. Pulmonary function stabilized, and he was gradually weaned off supplemental oxygen. \n\nThroughout his hospital stay, blood cultures remained negative, and susceptibility testing confirmed the initial choice of antibiotics to be appropriate. By the fifth day, he was afebrile, his blood parameters normalized, and he was switched to oral azithromycin. Mr. Hargrove received comprehensive education regarding his condition and diabetes management and was encouraged to follow up with his primary care physician for ongoing assessment and care. He was discharged home on day six of hospitalization with instructions to complete a five-day course of oral antibiotics and was advised on the importance of smoking cessation benefits.",

He reported that his symptoms began insidiously with increased sputum production and dyspnea, which became progressively worse despite using his prescribed inhalers. He also noted a low-grade fever and an increase in fatigue, prompting him to seek medical care.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Mr. Ellis has a long-standing history of COPD, diagnosed approximately 10 years ago, attributed to his extensive history of smoking. He also has a history of hypertension, diagnosed 20 years ago, being managed with lisinopril. He has had one prior hospitalization for a COPD exacerbation 18 months prior. Mr. Ellis has been advised previously to quit smoking but continues to smoke approximately a pack a day.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY: Mr. Ellis lives alone in a single-story home. He is a widower with three adult children who live out of state. Despite his respiratory issues, he remains relatively independent, although he receives occasional help from a neighbor with heavier chores. He quit his lifelong carpentry job at age 65 due to his respiratory difficulties. He has been smoking since he was 18 years old, with multiple attempts to quit, none successful. He consumes alcohol socially but denies illicit drug use.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On examination, Mr. Ellis appeared in mild respiratory distress. He had an oxygen saturation of 88% on room air, which improved to 94% on supplemental oxygen. Breath sounds revealed prolonged expiration with bilateral wheezing. Cardiovascular examination was unremarkable except for an irregularly irregular heartbeat. No peripheral edema was noted. His weight was noted to have decreased compared to last recorded visit.\n\nLABORATORY DATA: Complete blood count showed an elevated white cell count consistent with infection. Basic metabolic panel was within normal limits except for chronic respiratory acidosis on arterial blood gas analysis. A chest X-ray indicated hyperinflation typical of COPD without focal consolidations. Sputum cultures were pending at the time of admission.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE: Mr. Ellis was managed with bronchodilators, intravenous corticosteroids, and antibiotics for suspected bacterial infection. Supplemental oxygen therapy was continued. Over the next few days, his respiratory status gradually improved, allowing tapering of oxygen therapy. Pulmonology was consulted, and they recommended optimizing COPD management and initiating a new long-acting beta-agonist along with an inhaled corticosteroid. A smoking cessation program was discussed, and Mr. Ellis expressed renewed interest in quitting smoking. He was also educated on recognition of early symptoms of exacerbation and instructed to arrange a follow-up appointment with his primary care physician to monitor his condition and adjust treatment as necessary. As his symptoms stabilized, Mr. Ellis was deemed fit for discharge to home with optimized medical therapy and instructions for follow-up care.",

    "record": "Patient Name: Samantha Lewis  \nPatient ID: 67843  \n\nADMISSION DIAGNOSIS  \nAcute Exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  \nSamantha Lewis is a 62-year-old female who presented to the emergency room with complaints of worsening shortness of breath, productive cough with yellowish sputum, and wheezing for the past three days. She reports increased fatigue and difficulty performing activities of daily living. Samantha noted that her symptoms began after a recent upper respiratory tract infection, which she tried to manage at home but experienced progressive difficulty in breathing. No fever, chest pain, or hemoptysis was reported. She uses an albuterol inhaler at home but admitted to increased use over the last week without relief.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY  \n- Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), diagnosed 10 years ago  \n- Hypertension  \n- Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  \n\nSOCIAL HISTORY  \nSamantha is a retired school teacher who lives with her husband in a smoke-free home. She has a 30-pack-year history of smoking but quit 12 years ago. She enjoys gardening and daily walks in her neighborhood. Samantha has two adult children and mentions limited alcohol use, consuming socially on weekends.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION  \nOn examination, the patient appeared to be in mild respiratory distress with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. She was afebrile, blood pressure was 140/88 mmHg, heart rate was 98 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation was 88% on room air, which improved to 94% with supplemental oxygen. Chest examination revealed bilateral wheezes but no crackles. Heart sounds were regular, and there was no peripheral edema noted.\n\nLABORATORY DATA  \n- CBC showed a white blood cell count of 11,000/mm\u00b3.  \n- Arterial blood gas indicated respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.32, pCO2 of 55 mmHg, and pO2 of 60 mmHg on room air.  \n- Chest X-ray revealed hyperinflation typical of COPD but no acute infiltrates.  \n\nHOSPITAL COURSE  \nSamantha was admitted to the hospital for further management of her acute COPD exacerbation. She was started on systemic corticosteroids and received nebulized bronchodilators, which resulted in improvement of her respiratory symptoms. Antibiotics were initiated due to the suspicion of a bacterial infection secondary to her recent upper respiratory illness. Blood glucose levels were monitored closely due to the steroid therapy, and her anti-diabetic medication was adjusted accordingly. Oxygen therapy was continued to maintain saturation above 90%, and Samantha participated actively in chest physiotherapy. Over the next four days, her symptoms gradually improved, and she was weaned off supplemental oxygen. Discharge planning included referral to pulmonary rehabilitation, emphasis on smoking cessation counseling, and an augmentation of her COPD management plan. Samantha was discharged with instructions to follow up with her primary care physician and pulmonologist within one week of discharge.",

    "record": "ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: The patient, a 47-year-old male accountant, was admitted with intractable headache and nausea for evaluation and management.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient, Mr. Richard Stanton, began experiencing severe headaches two days prior to admission. The headaches started suddenly while he was at his desk at work, described as a pulsating pain on the right side of his head. Concurrently, he reported sensitivity to light and sound, along with episodes of nausea. He attempted to treat the headache at home with over-the-counter analgesics, but they provided no relief. After the onset of the headache, he visited the emergency room, where a clinical evaluation led to the diagnosis of migraine with aura and he was admitted for further observation and pain management.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Mr. Stanton has a medical history significant for hypertension, which is controlled with lisinopril. He also has a history of seasonal allergies and has previously suffered from episodic migraine headaches, although not this severe. No known drug allergies. He had an appendectomy at age 24 without complications.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY: Mr. Stanton lives with his wife and two children in the suburbs. He is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol socially, typically preferring wine on weekends. He works as an accountant and mentions that his job can be quite stressful, particularly during the tax season. He exercises regularly, running three times a week, and follows a heart-healthy diet as advised for managing his hypertension.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On examination, the patient appeared in moderate distress due to headache pain. Vital signs on admission showed a blood pressure of 142/88 mmHg, heart rate of 78 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and temperature of 98.6\u00b0F. Neurological examination was significant for photophobia but no focal neurological deficits. Fundoscopic examination was within normal limits. Cardiovascular, respiratory, and gastrointestinal examinations were unremarkable.\n\nLABORATORY DATA: Routine blood work including complete blood count, electrolytes, and metabolic panel were within normal limits. A head CT scan performed in the ER to rule out intracranial pathology was negative for acute intracranial abnormalities.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE: During his admission, Mr. Stanton was started on a regimen of intravenous fluids and was given sumatriptan for acute migraine treatment, in addition to an antiemetic to address the nausea. Pain management strategies also included non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and eventual administration of a corticosteroid due to the persistence of pain. Over the next 24 hours, his symptoms began to subside. Neurology was consulted, and it was recommended that Mr. Stanton initiate a prophylactic treatment to decrease the frequency of migraine attacks, with options discussed being propranolol or topiramate. Mr. Stanton was educated on lifestyle modifications, including stress management and avoidance of known migraine triggers such as caffeine and lack of sleep. By the third hospital day, his headache had resolved, and he was discharged home in good condition with follow-up arranged for outpatient neurologic evaluation.",
