      "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n",
      "Upon initial assessment, the patient reported feeling severely unwell over the preceding three days, exhibiting high fevers and dyspnea that gradually worsened. Prior to presentation, episodes of coughing had resulted in moderate production of yellowish sputum, which raised concern among family members, leading to the decision to seek medical help due to a marked decline in condition, especially as the patient's symptoms intensified and were nonresponsive to over-the-counter medications at home.\n",

      "PAST MEDICAL HISTORY\n",
      "This patient's past health history was noteworthy for a significant diagnosis of stage iiic breast cancer diagnosed two years ago, for which surgical intervention occurred. Postoperative recovery and follow-up adjuvant therapy, however, only consisted of hormone treatment given the age and wishes of the patient. Notably, medication lists included omeprazole, metoprolol, simvastatin, aspirin, metformin for controlled, noninsulin dependent type two diabetes, with blood work indicating generally good blood glucose levels as per hemoglobin A1C readings, alongside blood pressure values under excellent command thanks to well managed antihypertensives as well.\n",

He admitted to taking over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications, including acetaminophen to help manage symptoms but with little relief.\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY\\nHe has hypertension for which he is treated with losartan and atorvastatin for elevated cholesterol. His history of recurrent kidney stones necessitates periodic follow-up and monitoring.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY\\nAs an avid smoker for nearly four decades and an active coffee drinker, there was concern about potential effects of caffeine and nicotine. The patient lives alone in his house but relies heavily on his family for support. Following discussions about his condition and treatment plan, modifications to his lifestyle were agreed upon to prevent future episodes.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\\nClinical findings revealed left costovertebral angle tenderness, indicative of the obstructive process, and significant weight loss was noticed in recent times due to the poor oral intake in response to discomfort. Examination otherwise did not detect abnormal physical findings aside from those that pointed towards severe dehydration status on clinical exam.\\n\\nLABORATORY DATA \\nBlood samples at hospitalization demonstrated elevations of creatinine at 2.5 mg/dl, a reflection of renal function impairment. Urinalysis showed the findings of significant bacteriuria. Serum calcium and phosphorus levels fell within normal limits with an unRemarkable liver panel.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE\\nThe clinical approach entailed aggressive fluid management including normal saline solution alongside analgesic support as acetaminophen to mitigate discomfort from ureteral colic pain episodes until stone fragments had passed through and pain dissipated with successful treatment of acute condition during his hospital stay. Intravenous antibiotic to cover gram-negative bacilli infections causing pyelonephritis were administered after identifying and interpreting lab tests from urinalysis indicating a urinary-tract-infection requiring hospital care. Monitoring showed recovery towards the normal limits of kidney function parameters as hydration replenished volume status over several hospital days resulting in discharge with oral medications that manage his symptoms posthospital care.', 'match': False}\n"
