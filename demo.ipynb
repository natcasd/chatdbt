      "Pancytosis with concerns for chronic myeloproliferative disorder versus myeloproliferative neoplasm was diagnosed in an eighty-year-old female retired school teacher, presenting to the emergency department upon advice of primary care for abnormal laboratory findings discovered during evaluation of fatigue.\n",
      "\n",
      "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n",
      "The patient reports several weeks of progressive and severe fatigue and weight loss that made daily tasks difficult, necessitating help with managing the household from family members. The primary care provider initially attributed these findings to aging, poor diet, and deconditioning but pursued laboratory evaluations when symptom severity necessitated an ER evaluation. This led to the discovery of abnormal blood work.\n",
      "\n",
      "PAST MEDICAL HISTORY\n",
      "Relevant medical conditions include coronary artery disease managed by medications including carvedilol, a prior appendicitis treated surgically at a young age, and diet-controlled type 2 diabetes.\n",
      "\n",
      "SOCIAL HISTORY\n",
      "The patient had smoked a pack and a half per week when her husband developed chronic lung disease but reduced smoking by two-thirds since then and continues with decreased frequency, citing this change as due in part to her husband needing a clean living environment for health improvement purposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n",
      "The initial evaluation at admission revealed a thin female appearing frail, slightly anxious but oriented times four. Vital signs are stable though there does exist pronounced lymphadenopathy and notable hepatosplenomegaly which were further studied in subsequent workup for etiology assessment.\n",
      "\n",
      "LABORATORY DATA\n",
      "A CBC with differential showed pancytosis concerning possible myeloproliferative neoplasm but initial peripheral blood film was felt suggestive of leukoerythroblastosis in bone marrow examination misleads to possible interpretation for chronic disease states including possible secondary causes in absence confirmatory studies, in an eighty-year-old female retired teaching staff. The patient had thrombophilic mutations that were noted during workup including Factor V that can increase the clotting tendency as noted through Factor V assay test in her labs which initially may appear not significantly impactful by a physician but when viewed with all patient information provided an interesting insight.\n",
      "\n",
      "HOSPITAL COURSE\n",
      "Patient underwent further testing, notably a flow cytometric evaluation alongside the initial findings that provided valuable evidence guiding treatment that may help address her disease state while a review and assessment through imaging were pursued, a notable CT scan showing diffuse lymph node involvement in the context of the previously discovered abnormal lab finding led a radiologist on a misinterpretation by patient regarding diffuse adenopathy, where patient inappropriately interpreted her PET result without considering her diffuse adenitis diagnosis previously and her physician felt patient understanding needed careful clarification with her bone findings being critical information. This necessitated a team of specialist, led by a primary medical care attending working closely, ensuring that her clinical care needs including addressing and alleviating the root concerns and her symptom improvement goals, alongside management by hematologists were fully achieved during this inpatient hospital stay with a view toward optimizing symptom relief measures post-discharge.\n",

      "This patient's acute illness began with general fatigue and a sore throat, quickly progressing to include cough and difficulty breathing. Over the two-week period, she experienced night sweats and lost seven pounds despite having an unusually good appetite. Prior to this episode, she felt perfectly healthy and was physically very active with a part-time job as an aerobics instructor. \n",
      "\n",
      "PAST MEDICAL HISTORY \n",
      "Her chronic conditions include mild intermittent asthma controlled using occasional doses of an albuterol inhaler. She reported receiving the flu and Covid vaccines as recommended during her regular physical exams at a college clinic. In childhood, a mild penicillin allergy with rash occurred. All dental issues, she said, were handled in a college oral clinic that managed students on her dental plan, but did not detail the treatment or specific diagnoses other than some minor cavities that were corrected.\n",

However, as physical education instructor, her schedule allowed a mix of physical activity during work as instructor with heavy student population of younger children. This lifestyle transition was accompanied by irregular use of alcohol on social engagements over many past social weekends while enjoying nightlife music and events on weekends but has significantly decreased such use following some recent life events in favor other pursuits outside teaching field now more frequently pursued instead in recent personal time outside that job description that now has allowed some return of physical activity outside work schedule as part of leisure or fun again without that past sedentary routine at home previously so predominant.\n",

      "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION \n",
      "Her vitals presented an oral temperature of 101.9 Fahrenheit along with pulse of 106, BP was 128/74 mm/Hg. Pulse-Ox revealed an oxygen saturation of 92% in room air upon intake at ER, later corrected using oxygen at increasing Fi0 percentages until adequate. Rales and other sounds detected at left lung on exam were indicative of left lobe consolidation. \n",

      "The admission diagnosis for eighty-two year old retired carpenter Harold Wilson was a lower gastrointestinal bleed, which prompted an urgent hospital admission for immediate evaluation and management.\n",
      "\n",
      "A detailed recount of events prior to admission by Harold Wilson revealed a history of melena over the past few days, characterized by frequent passage of maroon-colored stools, and significant weakness. The passage of these stools began about seventy-two hours prior to hospital admission and became gradually more frequent and was accompanied by a mild to moderate degree of abdominal cramping not specifically localized to any area of the abdomen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prior to the onset of these gastrointestinal symptoms Harold had been managed as an outpatient with hypertension for more than twenty-five years and also had established coronary artery disease which included previous percutaneous interventions as well as being diabetic. He also suffered from early-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that has not necessitated recent emergency or clinic medical interventions within the last eighteen months, aside for regular follow-ups. Harold takes aspirin one hundred milligrams and atorvastatin twenty milligrams every day for cardiovascular health together with insulin glargine forty-seven units before sleep and also insulin aspart prior to most lunches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harold has been living alone since becoming widowed nine years ago in a house near an elementary school and leads a relatively simple and unremarkable social life spending his mornings performing low-intensity carpentry jobs to maintain physical flexibility and spends evenings listening either to books read aloud from public broadcasting services on television, taking gentle twenty-minute walks every now and then depending on seasonal weather. \n",
      "\n",
      "Clinical observations of a generally fragile physical stature was immediately evident while performing examination on Harold during admission. On his physical examination Harold displayed signs indicating some evidence of an anemia which manifested as a generalised pallor and his cardiac and pulmonary examinations did seem within expected norms. Not much was immediately detected concerning abdominal palpations, and bowel sounds appear reduced in both tone and frequency, likely an indication Harold is experiencing ongoing gastrointestinal tract bleeding that will necessitate careful haemodynamic support during the early acute care in his admission to manage and reduce ongoing anaemia, alongside blood investigations as part diagnostic process and monitoring.\n",
      "\n",
      "Preliminary results from an admission lab showed that his baseline hematocrit levels are below thirty-one, alongside an increased prothrombin time of twenty-one seconds thus revealing his need to receive multiple unit blood transfusion which he received shortly in intensive care and during it Mr Wilson experienced the first signs of hemolytic transfusion reaction requiring discontinuation after only sixty millilitres administration was observed, resulting promptly from onset, this reaction led Mr Harold immediately undergo additional evaluation with further diagnostics, with more lab draws, imaging ordered in a rush, with additional medication started urgently, which led ultimately Harold being placed for monitoring, as clinically appropriate in Intensive Care.\n",
      "\n",
      "The progression and monitoring during initial care on admission involved multiple specialists and interventions as is typical in such bleeding incidents where patient instability occurs. During monitoring the acute gastrointestinal source was diagnosed with endoscopy revealing one large polyp at the descending left flexure region requiring a subsequent endoscopic clipping procedure, performed on the day post first observation, this stabilised bleeding in the region effectively without further intervention on this particular region required and he went into monitoring on a step down for several days prior discharge from a stable recovery. During that time Mr Harold showed some increase from admission on baseline haematocrit of forty-seven without needing a requirement of transfusion therapy during or following recovery stay within step-down recovery and this was monitored in conjunction\n",
